# Supported signatures

The following tables list the supported method signatures and indicate
the various supported features. For instance, they indicate the default
and available acknowledgement strategies (when applicable).

Note that in additional to the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification,
SmallRye Reactive Messaging supports the post-processing acknowledgment handling with automatic metadata propagation for the following signatures:

- `@Outgoing @Incoming Message<O> method(I payload)`
- `@Outgoing @Incoming CompletionStage<Message<O>> method(I payload)`
- `@Outgoing @Incoming Uni<Message<O>> method(I payload)`
- `@Outgoing @Incoming Message<O> method(Message<I> payload)` : For this signature, the post-processing acknowledgment handling is limited.
  It covers cases for nacking incoming messages on caught exceptions at the method body, acking incoming messages when outgoing message is skipped by returning `null`, and chaining acknowlegment from outgoing message to the incoming.
  However, if the incoming message has already been (n)acked, you will experience duplicate (n)acks.

!!!important
    When processing `Message`, it is often required to *chain* the incoming
    `Message` to enable post-processing acknowledgement and metadata
    propagation. Use the `with` (like `withPayload`) methods from the
    incoming message, so it copies the metadata and ack/nack methods. It
    returns a new `Message` with the right content.
